# UnrealEngine_ThirdPersonController
The purpose of this project is to create a Third Person Character Controller for action-adventure titles to demonstrate my skill as a game developer.

The content hosted in this repository includes all the necessary Blueprint, .cpp, and .h files to run the program, as well as additional environment meshes and the standard blueprints from Unreal's Third Person Template. In addition, if you retrieve the Head from the Main branch you can run this in Unreal Engine 5 Early Access to examine my Blueprints.

This project is implemented in Unreal Engine 5 Early Access, with plans to take advantage of the FBIK, Motion Warping, and Control Rig tools for advanced animation and gameplay capabilities.

IMPORTANT NOTE: all third-party/licensed content has been removed from the repository and will be maintained locally. This includes the animations, which are the intellectual property of Amplify. Therefore, if you pull the head from the repository and attempted to run the game the character will maintain a static pose.

If you want to see the project running in action, please watch this test footage I have edited and uploaded to YouTube:
